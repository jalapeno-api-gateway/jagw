The Jalape単o API Gateway provides, as the name suggests, an API Gateway for the [Jalape単o](https://github.com/jalapeno) application stack developed by [Cisco Systems Inc.](https://www.cisco.com/). Jalape単o collects and processes data from a [Segment Routing](https://www.segment-routing.net/) network.

The Jalape単o API Gateway has been developed by the [INS - Institue for Networked Solutions](https://www.segment-routing.ch/ins/about-us/) at the [OST - Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences](https://www.ost.ch/en/) in cooperation with [Cisco Systems Inc.](https://www.cisco.com/).
